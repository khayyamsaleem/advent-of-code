* Intcode Rules

**  Vague type-signature-ish specification

#+BEGIN_SRC

program -> [instruction]

instruction -> ([param_mode], opcode)

len([param_mode]) == arity(opcode)


eval_param(program, param_to_arg_rules, mode, param) => arg

eval_opcode(program, opcode_rules, opcode, [args]) -> mutated_program

#+END_SRC


Evaluating an instruction mutates the program in-place as of now.

A program's execution state can be thunked as ~(program, instruction-pointer)~

The interpreter also has a notion of user-input, a queue of inputs to consume from at the user-input instruction. The program "blocks" when the input queue is empty and asks the evaluating entity for more input, thunking program state until it can continue.

~param_to_arg_rules~
| name      | param_mode | usage                                     |
| ====      | ========== | =====                                     |
| position  |          0 | ~(vector-ref prg (vector-ref prg param))~ |
| immediate |          1 | ~(vector-ref prg param)~                  |


~opcode_rules~
| name | opcode | arity | usage                                      |
| ==== |   ==== |  ==== | ============================               |
| add  |      1 |     3 | ~(vector-set! prog arg3 (+ arg1 arg2))~    |
| mul  |      2 |     3 | ~(vector-set! prog arg3 (+ arg1 arg2))~    |
| move |      3 |     1 | ~(vector-set! prog arg1 (car user-input))~ |
| out  |      4 |     1 | ~(displayln arg1) (cons arg1 outputs)~     |
| jit  |      5 |     2 | ~(if (zero? arg1) (jmp arg2) (jmp 3))~     |
| jif  |      6 |     2 | ~not jit~                                  |
| brlt |      7 |     3 | ~(if (< arg1 arg2) (jmp arg3) (jmp 4))~    |
| breq |      8 |     3 | ~(if (= arg1 arg2) (jmp arg3) (jmp 4))~    |
| halt |     99 |     0 | ~(vector-ref prog 0)~                      |


* End Goal
Be able to extend the ~param=>arg~ and ~opcode_rules~ tables at runtime.

* Notes
It is very possible that the entire interpreter will need to be re-written to accomodate this design and functionality. I am fine with that.
